### Hi

My name is Robert Williams. I am a multi-disciplined developer who currently resides in Philadelphia, PA. I enjoy new challenges, friendly people, and simplifying complex issues.

### Professional Snippets

I formerly worked in print & web design before moving into web development years ago. My background is in front-end and CMS development. I've primarily worked in Wordpress, Shopify, and I very much like Craft CMS. I can work in most CMS systems and I want to work more with vanilla javascript and modern frameworks such as Vue and React.

### Personal Snippets

I have an art background so I love museums and modern art. I also like games and puzzles. I have recently built my first Hackintosh from scratch and I am also kinda' obsessed with mechanical keyboards.
