I just want to upfront about this. I love video games. I have spent a lot of my small hours reading web design blogs and playing video games. One of the constant points of contention with friends that have similar interests is game aesthetic and design. This is something that puts me off to a lot of AAA blockbuster releases. These companies have budgets the size of movies, and still manage to create poorly designed mechanics with mediocre voice acting. The indy gaming boom of the past 10-15 years has proven that you don't need an infinite budget. I believe that this has started a trend of a more unified visual experience, as well as more polished game mechanics.
